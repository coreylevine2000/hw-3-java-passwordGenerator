# hw-3-java-passwordGenerator

This is a simple password generator:

The user is able to select a password length, within a predetermined length range.

Once selected, the user is able to choose, via prompt, how they would like their password characters presented:
lower case, UPPER CASE, numerical, or special.

Finally the password will be displayed via the page's text box for the user. 

If no character selection, nor length falls outside of length perameters, user will be prompted to start again.
